Try it here: https://emlun.se/spire-map-gui/

I made this because it seemed like an interesting project to build, I have no particular plans to keep developing it.


Requirements

- [npm][npm]


Usage

To run the development server:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
$ $BROWSER http://localhost:8080
```

To build artifacts:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

Then copy the contents of `build/` into your favourite web server.
